GRADING

The grading for the course will be based on the better of the two schemes:

               H       M       F
               10      20      70
               20      30      50


NOTE 1: This grading scheme is provisional.  It may be adjusted
         according to how the course develops.

NOTE 2: For the most part, letter grades will be awarded according
to the guideline laid down in the undergraduate calendar
e.g.  C- = 60-62, C = 63-66, C+ = 67-69, etc.   However I
reserve the right to raise the standard for B, B+, A-, A and A+,
depending on the class curve, i,e. for an A+ you may need
more than 90, etc.

NOTE 3: Students taking the graduate component CS6TC3 may be
required to do extra assignment(s).

NOTE 4: MSAF
A student who wants to receive accommodation for missed academic work
due to an absence needs to complete a McMaster Student Absence Form
(MSAF) on-line at  http://www.mcmaster.ca/msaf/ .  When the MSAF tool
asks you for the party who should receive your request for
accommodation, enter  zucker@mcmaster.ca.

*** Students are reminded that they are expected         ***
*** to contact the instructor after filling out an MSAF. ***

The accomodation for a missed homework will be
the exclusion of that homework from the grade calculation.

The accomodation for missing the midterm will be
a four day delay, after which a deferred midterm will be administered.



HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS

There will be weekly homework problems, sent to the class by email
(see below) on Wed. evening, and due back (electronically)
to Mark the following Tuesday at 6 pm.

         LATE HOMEWORK CANNOT BE ACCEPTED.

Although you may discuss the general concepts of the course material
with your classmates, your homework must be your individual effort.
If anything in the interpretation of a problem is unclear to you,
send me email rather than ask a friend.  Your question may induce me
to make a public announcement to clarify the question or give a hint.



EMAIL:

You must read the class email at least once a day.



MIDTERM AND FINAL EXAMS

These will be essentially OPEN BOOK, TAKE-HOME exams.
However (unlike with the homeworks) there must be NO DISCUSSION of
the problems with anyone else.  This will work on an HONOUR SYSTEM.

ACADEMIC DISHONESTY

Academic dishonesty consists of misrepresentation by deception or by
other fraudulent means and can result in serious consequences, e.g.,
the grade of zero on an assignment, loss of credit with a notation on
the transcript (notation reads: "Grade of F assigned for academic
dishonesty"), and/or suspension or expulsion from the university.

It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes academic
dishonesty. For information on the various kinds of academic
dishonesty please refer to the Academic Integrity Policy, specifically
Appendix 3, located at

<a href="https://secretariat.mcmaster.ca/app/uploads/Academic-Integrity-Policy-1-1.pdf">https://secretariat.mcmaster.ca/app/uploads/Academic-Integrity-Policy-1-1.pdf</a>



STATEMENT ON DISCRIMINATION

The Faculty of Engineering is concerned with ensuring an environment that
is free of all adverse discrimination.  If there is a problem, that
cannot be resolved by discussion among the persons concerned, individuals
are reminded that they should contact their Department Chair and the
Equity and Inclusion Office (EIO) office as soon as possible.
