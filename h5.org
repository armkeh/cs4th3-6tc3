(1) Bonus question (2), i.e. the equivalence of
    SI and CVI, is still open!  
    I plan to give the solution on
    the Tuesday or Wednesday after reading week,
    so try to solve it before then.

(2) Hwk 6 will be released on Tuesday October 21st.
    It will include exercises 2 and 3 on page 5-13,
    which you should be able to solve now.
    So you may want to think about these during reading week.

(3) Exercise 4 on page 5-13 becomes simpler using some of the the theory 
    developed in Section 6, so don't worry about it now.
