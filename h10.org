Note: In this question, all functions are be *total*.

First we define:
1. The characteristic function $\textit{char}(A)$ of a subset $A$ of $ℕ$
   is as defined on page 1-6.
2. The /positive/ set of a function $f$, called $\textit{pos}(f)$,
   is defined as $\textit{pos}(f) = \{ x ∈ ℕ | f(x) > 0 \}$.
3. For subsets $A$ of $ℕ$:
   1. $A$ is /PR/ iff $\textit{char}(A)$ is /PR/.
   2. $A$ is 𝒢-computable iff $\textit{char}(A)$ is 𝒢-computable (as in the Notes).

Now, *you must prove*: For subsets $A$ of $ℕ$, 
1. $A$ is /PR/ iff $A$ is the positive set of a /PR/ function.
2. $A$ is /𝒢-comp/ iff $A$ is the positive set of a 𝒢-computable function.

Finally, using the above, *also prove that*:
3. /PR/ is a proper subclass of /𝒢-COMP/.
