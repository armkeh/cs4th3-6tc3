- October 28th ::

  - Notes section 8 has been posted.
  - The version of notes section 7 has also been updated
    to a slightly newer version.
    - There are likely no major changes,
      and possibly not even minor changes;
      but if you save a local copy,
      you should change to the new version.
  - Recent lecture and tutorial recording links have been added.

- October 24th ::

  (This information was announced in class, but was not
  posted to the website yet.)

  The midterm examination will be a take-home test released
  on Friday, October 30th and due the following Monday by 6pm.

  Some review material and hints as to content will be posted
  here on the course homepage over the next week,
  under the new ‚ÄúTests‚Äù section.

  And there will be review for the midterm at least during the
  tutorial on Friday (October 30th.)
  
- October 21st ::

  Your classmate, Genevieve Maalouf, is running
  a seminar for women in mathematics *today* starting at 2:45pm.
  We encourage you to sit in if you are available;
  [[http://johannafranklin.net/][Dr.¬†Johanna N.Y.¬†Franklin]],
  a computability theoreist from Hofstra University,
  will be giving a talk (details below).

  A link to the meeting is [[https://mcmaster.zoom.us/j/96116965732?pwd=ZUVpOGpqalkzcG1WQk00Z2FWSXYrQT09][here]]. The password is ~949862~ (and if needed,
  the meeting number is ~961 1696 5732~.) As mentioned,
  the meeting will be starting at 2:45pm.

  Thank you Gen!

  *Title: Algorithmic randomness and its connections to analysis*
  
  Abstract:
  #+begin_quote
I will characterize randomness using concepts from computability theory with
three different approaches as starting points: algorithmic information
theory, probability, and measure theory. After discussing what it means to
say that an infinite binary sequence is random, I'll extend this notion to
more traditional mathematical contexts and explain the strong relationships
that exist between algorithmic randomness and classical theorems in
analysis.

- October 13th :: Homework 5 has been posted.

- October 7th :: A Microsoft Teams team has been created
  for the course.

  It is not a requirement that you use Teams;
  all course material and announcments will still be
  distributed by email and by this website.
  
  This is simply meant to provide an option
  to communicate with your classmates or with Mark.
  So far, there are channels for discussing
  the notes and the homework.

- October 7th :: The new section of notes (notes 6)
  and recent lecture recordings have been posted.

- October 5th :: I (Mark) have added hints to homework 4.
  - The hint to use induction was mentioned in Friday's tutorial.
  - Also see the hint regarding how to show $f$ is total.

- October 3rd :: Notes from yesterday's tutorial have been posted.

- October 2nd :: Homework 4 has been posted.
  - Additionally, a new section was added to this site
    which collects all the bonus questions in one place.

- September 25th :: The fourth set of notes has been uploaded.
  - For the moment, I have uploaded older versions of notes 3 and 4
    which may have some minor differences from those used in lectures.
    Later today I will upload the most recent versions.
    - So if you are saving these notes locally,
      you may need to download them again once I announce
      the more recent versions have been posted.

- September 23rd :: The third homework has been posted.
- September 23rd :: The third set of notes has been uploaded.

- Date: Friday October 30th, 1:00pm ‚Äì Monday November 2nd, 6:30pm
- Coverage: Up to notes section 6 and homework 6.
  - Although notes 6 is included, the only content from it
    which may be tested are the techniques introduced
    for primitive recursive definitions.
    - For example, definition by simultaneous primitive recursion. 
    - G√∂del numbering itself and related concepts,
      such as the definitions of pairs and sequences, will not be covered.

Bonus questions are:
- Released alongside the homeworks, but are not due when
  the homework is due.
  - Instead, they are due any time before solutions
    are given in lecture.
- To be submitted to Dr.¬†Zucker, not Mark.
- Not assigned a specific weight; instead, completion of bonus questions
  could lead to a slight increase in your final grade
  if it is close to the cutoff for a higher grade point.

** The questions
:PROPERTIES:

:END:

1. Prove the equivalence of the induction schemes SI and CVI.
   - Hint: you may have to change the predicate $P$ in going
     from one scheme to the other.
2. Prove the equivalence of CVI and LNP.
   - Hint: as above, you may have to change the predicate $P$ in going
     from one scheme to the other.
