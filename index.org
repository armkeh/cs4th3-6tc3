** Bonus question policy

:CUSTOM_ID: Bonus-question-policy
:END:

Bonus questions are:
- Released alongside the homeworks, but are not due when
  the homework is due.
  - Instead, they are due any time before solutions
    are given in lecture.
- To be submitted to Dr.¬†Zucker, not Mark.
- Not assigned a specific weight; instead, completion of bonus questions
  could lead to a slight increase in your final grade
  if it is close to the cutoff for a higher grade point.

** The questions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: The-questions
:END:

1. Prove the equivalence of the induction schemes SI and CVI.
   - Hint: you may have to change the predicate $P$ in going
     from one scheme to the other.
2. Prove the equivalence of CVI and LNP.
   - Hint: as above, you may have to change the predicate $P$ in going
     from one scheme to the other.
