Prove Cor. 1.5(c), the ‚Äú‚áí‚Äù direction.

Parts (a) and (b), and the ‚Äú‚áê‚Äù direction of (c) were 
proved in class.

For *extra credit*, give a proof that is ‚Äúalgebraic‚Äù, 
i.e., does not mention individual elements of the sets $A$ and $B$.

Prove that
1. <<2.a>>
   a right inverse need not be a left inverse, and vice versa,
2. <<2.b>>
   a left inverse need not be unique,
3. <<2.c>>
   a right inverse need not be unique,
4. a two-sided inverse *is* unique.

See p.1-7, Note.

In [[2.a]], [[2.b]], [[2.c]] give examples.

Because the number of problems in this section of the Notes is 
much greater than those in the next section, I am postponing the 
two questions below (which really belong here) to NEXT WEEK'S HOMEWORK.
I am nevertheless putting them here now, so that you can start thinking 
about them sooner, if you wish.

Prove
1. If $A ‚âà B$ and $A$ is finite then so is $B$.
2. If $A ‚âà B$ and $A$ is countably infinite then so is $B$.
3. If $A ‚âà B$ and $A$ is uncountable then so is $B$.

See Note (f), p.1-10.

** Hwk 3 (2)

Prove Theorem 1.13 (c): $\text{PRED}(‚Ñï)$ is uncountable.
Use a diagonalization method.

/Do not/ use the fact that
$\text{PRED}(‚Ñï)$ is equinumerous with $ùí´(‚Ñï)$.
